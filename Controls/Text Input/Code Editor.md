# Code Editor

This is some YAML you can paste into your canvas Power Apps applciation that will serve well as a code editor. It's a multi-line text input that has a Courier New font and a grey background. It's also got some padding so it looks nice. You can use it to edit your Power Apps code, or to edit any other kind of code. It's a great way to get started with Power Apps development, or to learn about Power Apps development.
