# Wire Framing

## What is Wire Framing?

Wireframing is a way to design a website service at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.

## Why is Wire Framing Important?

Wireframing is important because it allows the designer to plan the layout and interaction of an interface without being distracted by colors, typeface choices or other design elements. It allows the designer to focus on the information architecture and user experience.

## How to Create a Wire Frame

1. **Start with a Sketch**: Begin by sketching out your ideas on paper. This will help you to quickly iterate on your ideas and make changes as needed.
2. **Use a Wire Framing Tool**: Once you have a rough sketch, you can use a wire framing tool to create a more detailed wire frame. There are many wire framing tools available, such as Sketch, Adobe XD, and Figma.
3. **Add Content**: Add content to your wire frame, such as text, images, and buttons. This will help you to visualize how the final design will look.
4. **Test Your Wire Frame**: Once you have created your wire frame, it's important to test it with users to ensure that it is easy to use and meets their needs.
5. **Iterate**: Based on user feedback, make any necessary changes to your wire frame and test it again. Continue this process until you have a wire frame that meets the needs of your users.
6. **Finalize Your Wire Frame**: Once you have a wire frame that meets the needs of your users, you can finalize it and move on to the visual design phase.
7. **Hand Off to Developers**: Once the visual design is complete, you can hand off the wire frame to developers (proabably yourself if you're a Power Apps dev) to begin building the final product.
