# Functions

Power Fx function patterns, user-defined functions, types, and algorithms.

## Directory Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [built-in/](./built-in/) | Built-in Power Fx function examples and patterns |
| [user-defined-functions/](./user-defined-functions/) | Custom UDF implementations |
| [user-defined-types/](./user-defined-types/) | Type definitions and schemas |
| [algorithms/](./algorithms/) | Algorithm implementations in Power Fx |
| [encoding-decoding/](./encoding-decoding/) | Encoding and decoding utilities |

## Built-in Functions

Examples and patterns for Power Fx built-in functions like ForAll, IsMatch, etc.

## User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

Custom functions created using the new Power Fx UDF feature for code reusability.

## User-Defined Types

Type definitions for structured data handling in Power Apps.

## Algorithms

Common algorithm implementations optimized for Power Fx.

## Encoding/Decoding

Base64, URL encoding, and other data transformation utilities.

## Quick Start

1. Browse [built-in](./built-in/) for function usage examples
2. Check [user-defined-functions](./user-defined-functions/) for custom function patterns
3. See [algorithms](./algorithms/) for common algorithm implementations
