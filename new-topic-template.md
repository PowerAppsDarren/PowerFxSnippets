## Directions

1. Create separate Markdown (.md) files for each snippet or related group of snippets.
2. Use descriptive names for your files, e.g. button-click-handler.md or gallery-filtering.md.
3. Structure each file as follows:
    - Start with a clear title using a level 1 header (#)
    - Add a brief description of the snippet's purpose
    - Use code blocks for the Power FX code
    - Include any additional explanations or usage notes.
