# Constants

```PowerFx
//
// Code Readability - constants eliminate "magic numbers" and meaningless values in code by 
//                    giving them descriptive names. Instead of seeing arbitrary numbers 
//                    scattered throughout the code, developers can understand the purpose 
//                    and meaning of values through well-named constants.
// Source of Truth -  when a value needs to be changed, modifying a constant requires 
//                    updating only one location rather than searching through the entire 
//                    codebase for every instance of that Value.
// Error Prevention - constants protect code integrity by preventing accidental modifications 
//                    during program execution. This is particularly valuable in large projects 
//                    with multiple developers, as it reduces debugging needs and prevents 
//                    unintended changes.
