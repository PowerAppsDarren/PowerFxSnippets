### Polar Night

Polar Night is made up of four darker colors that are commonly used for base elements like backgrounds or text color in bright ambiance designs.

nord0
The origin color or the Polar Night palette.

For dark ambiance designs, it is used for background and area coloring while it's not used for syntax highlighting at all because otherwise it would collide with the same background color.

For bright ambiance designs, it is used for base elements like plain text, the text editor caret and reserved syntax characters like curly- and square brackets.
It is rarely used for passive UI elements like borders, but might be possible to achieve a higher contrast and better visual distinction (harder/not flat) between larger components.

nord1
A brighter shade color based on nord0.

For dark ambiance designs it is used for elevated, more prominent or focused UI elements like

status bars and text editor gutters
panels, modals and floating popups like notifications or auto completion
user interaction/form components like buttons, text/select fields or checkboxes
It also works fine for more inconspicuous and passive elements like borders or as dropshadow between different components.
There's currently no official port project that makes use of it for syntax highlighting.

For bright ambiance designs, it is used for more subtle/inconspicuous UI text elements that do not need so much visual attention.
Other use cases are also state animations like a more brighter text color when a button is hovered, active or focused.

nord2
An even more brighter shade color of nord0.

For dark ambiance designs, it is used to colorize the currently active text editor line as well as selection- and text highlighting color.
For both bright & dark ambiance designs it can also be used as an brighter variant for the same target elements like nord1.

nord3
The brightest shade color based on nord0.

For dark ambiance designs, it is used for UI elements like indent- and wrap guide marker.
In the context of code syntax highlighting it is used for comments and invisible/non-printable characters.

For bright ambiance designs, it is, next to nord1 and nord2 as darker variants, also used for the most subtle/inconspicuous UI text elements that do not need so much visual attention.
