    // 
    // Understanding the parameters: 
    //   - Pass in width values to get the X value for 'Self'
    //   - Pass in height values to get the Y value for 'Self'   
    //
    fxGetCenteredDimension( ParentDimension:Number, 
                            SelfDimension:Number):Number = (
        (ParentDimension - SelfDimension) / 2
    );
