## Chosen Format For Repository

For posting snippets of Power FX code for Canvas Power Apps on GitHub, perhaps the best way is to use Markdown files with code blocks. This approach offers several advantages. Any other format you find here will eventually be converted to this format. 

1. Create separate Markdown (.md) files for each snippet or related group of snippets.
2. Use descriptive names for your files, e.g. button-click-handler.md or gallery-filtering.md.
3. Structure each file as follows:
    - Start with a clear title using a level 1 header (#)
    - Add a brief description of the snippet's purpose
    - Use code blocks for the Power FX code
    - Include any additional explanations or usage notes.
