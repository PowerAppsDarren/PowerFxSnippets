# AI Chat Session: UV path fix and statusline configuration

**Date:** 2025-08-19  
**Time Started:** 21:15:28  
**Project:** PowerFxSnippets  
**Instance:** Claude Code

## Session Summary

Fixed persistent UV package manager warning in terminal and configured Claude Code statusLine with traditional shell PS1-style formatting.

## Conversation

### Initial Request
User reported: "I always get this when I start a new terminal window: ⚠️ UV not found - install with: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh"
Despite having run the install command, the warning persisted.

### Technical Details

**UV Path Issue:**
- UV was installed at `/home/darren/.local/bin/uv` but not properly in PATH
- Warning appeared on every new terminal window
- PATH needed explicit configuration in .zshrc

**StatusLine Configuration:**
- Used specialized `statusline-setup` agent to configure PS1-style format
- New format: `[Model] user@host:~/path (git-branch)* [stats] $`
- Preserves all existing Claude Code features

### Key Exchanges

1. **UV Investigation:** Found UV installed but PATH not configured
2. **Path Fix:** Added PATH exports to .zshrc in two locations
3. **StatusLine Request:** User requested configuration via /statusline command
4. **AI Chat Creation:** User reminded to create session documentation

## Files Modified

- `~/.zshrc` - Added PATH exports on lines 9 and 118 for UV
- `~/.claude/statusline-todo-counter.sh` - Enhanced with PS1-style formatting
- `ai-chats/2025-08-19-01-uv-path-fix-and-statusline-configuration.md` - Created session documentation

## Lessons Learned

- UV installation requires explicit PATH configuration in shell startup files
- StatusLine configuration must use specialized agent for proper setup
- Always create ai-chats documentation at session start (per CLAUDE.md rules)
- Shell PS1 traditional format can be successfully integrated with Claude Code features

## Next Steps

- Monitor if UV warning persists (could be from system-wide scripts or terminal emulator)
- StatusLine now configured and functional with enhanced format
- Continue using ai-chats-manager for session documentation
