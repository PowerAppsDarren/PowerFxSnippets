Based on my analysis of the PowerFxSnippets repository, I'll now create a comprehensive constitution that reflects the project's nature as a community-driven snippet library.

## PowerFxSnippets Constitution - Summary

### ✅ Constitution Created Successfully

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Ratified**: 2025-11-19
**Last Amended**: 2025-11-19

### 📋 Core Principles Established

The constitution defines **6 core principles** tailored to PowerFxSnippets as a community-driven snippet repository:

1. **Feature-First Organization (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** - Use case driven structure, max 3-level depth, kebab-case naming
2. **Metadata-Driven Discoverability** - Required YAML frontmatter with standardized fields for all snippets
3. **Quality Over Quantity** - Strict code and documentation quality standards before acceptance
4. **Community-First Contribution** - Welcoming, clear, frictionless contribution process with templates
5. **Automation & Validation** - Automated quality checks (frontmatter, links, formatting, categorization)
6. **Preservation & Migration** - Never delete content during restructuring; archive and redirect instead

### 🎯 Additional Governance Sections

- **Quality Standards**: Snippet structure, testing requirements, documentation standards
- **Repository Governance**: Versioning (rolling release), review/approval process, feature development workflow
- **Governance**: Constitution authority, compliance requirements, spec-kit integration, amendment process

### ✅ Template Consistency Validation

All Spec-Kit templates verified for alignment:

- ✅ **spec-template.md** - Aligned with metadata requirements and user story prioritization
- ✅ **plan-template.md** - Includes "Constitution Check" gate and feature-first structure
- ✅ **tasks-template.md** - Supports validation tasks and automated quality enforcement

### 📝 Version Bump Rationale

- Establishes foundational governance for PowerFxSnippets
- Defines 6 core principles specific to snippet repository management
- Sets quality, contribution, and automation standards
